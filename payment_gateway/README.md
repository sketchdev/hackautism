Hackathon:
  Attack of the Retreating Invisible Cows

Setup Instructions
===================


AWS CLI
--------

Having the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) installed helps get the credentials set up locally for running shell commands
to create resources inside of AWS.  Follow the instructions from [AWS' official documenation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) to get it installed.


Serverless Info
----------------
A serverless version of this application has been established by leveraging the aws-serverless-express npm module. This
module wraps an Express app so that it conforms to AWS Lambda handler method signatures and can be deployed into Lambda,
yet it uses Express' router to route and deliver the requests to the appropriate controllers.

### Running Locally ###

#### SAM-CLI Installation ####
See [AWS' official documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli#installation) for the latest instructions for
installing the SAM CLI. The abridged version is this:

  * Make sure python 2.7 is installed

    `python --version`
  * Update pip

    `pip install --user --upgrade pip`
  * Install aws-sam-cli

    `pip install --user aws-sam-cli`
  * Verify sam successfully installed

    `sam --version`

##### Issues Installing SAM-CLI #####
`pip show -f aws-sam-cli`

Should show where files were installed:
  ```Shell
  Name: aws-sam-cli
  Version: 0.3.0

    aws_sam_cli-0.3.0-py2.7.egg-info/SOURCES.txt
  ```

The "../../../bin/sam" entry (will be different depending on what directory you are currently in) shows where the sam executable was installed to. Ensure this absolute path is included in your PATH variable. If it is not, edit your ~/.bash_profile file to do so. This absolute path can be found by running:
`python -m site --user-base`

If this wasn't your issue, refer to the official AWS documenation mentioned above.


Create an AWS Account
----------------------

 * Go to https://aws.amazon.com & click sign-up
   * redirects to https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=default&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start
 * Enter personal and billing information
 * Verify info by allowing AWS to call your entered phone number and type the verification code on your phone


Log in to AWS Account
----------------------

 * Go to http://console.aws.amazon.com/
 * Enter root account username and password
   * you may need to enter CAPTCHA info on first login


Create Non-Root User(s)
------------------------

Other than to create auxiliary users or requesting service line increases, the root account should NEVER be used
for signing in to AWS. Follow these steps to set up a minimal admin user to use for the rest of this setup.

 * Go to AWS' [IAM service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/users) to manage users
 * Click the 'Add user' button
   * Provide a username and password
   * Specify that this user should have programmatic and console access
   * Proceed to Permissions...
   * Click the 'Attach existing policies directly' tab
   * Select 'AdministratorAccess'
   * Click 'Review'
   * Click 'Create'
   * Copy the 'Access key ID' and the 'Secret access key' from this screen
     * **THIS IS THE ONLY TIME YOU WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE 'SECRET ACCESS KEY', SO MAKE SURE YOU SAVE IT SOMEWHERE BEFORE PROCEEDING**
 * Use the AWS CLI (installed near the beginning of this document) to add these access keys
   * From your command line, type `aws configure`
   * Enter your Access Key
   * Enter your Secret Key
   * Enter 'us-east-1' for the 'Default region name'


Set Up Code Bucket
-------------------

To deploy the serverless version of this code, you will need to create a secured "bucket" in AWS' storage service.

From your command line,

  ```Shell
  aws s3 mb s3://com-lifebinder-sam
  ```


APPENDIX
---------

### PCI Loose-Ends ###

PCI at AWS ain't that hard.  There's a couple of things this app needs *for compliance*, but *not* needed for normal functionality.

#### Activity Logging ####

The first step is to create a bucket to hold all the AWS activity logging. From your command line,

   ```Shell
   aws s3 mb s3://com-lifebinder-pci
   aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket com-lifebinder-pci --policy "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"AWSCloudTrailAclCheck\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"cloudtrail.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"s3:GetBucketAcl\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::com-lifebinder-pci\"},{\"Sid\":\"AWSCloudTrailWrite\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"cloudtrail.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"s3:PutObject\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::com-lifebinder-pci\/AWSLogs\/*\",\"Condition\":{\"StringEquals\":{\"s3:x-amz-acl\":\"bucket-owner-full-control\"}}}]}"
   ```

Now that the bucket is in place, the next step is to configure AWS to log all activity to the newly created
bucket. From your command line,

   ```Shell
   aws cloudtrail create-trail --name LifeBinderTrail --s3-bucket-name com-lifebinder-pci --include-global-service-events --is-multi-region-trail
   aws cloudtrail start-logging --name LifeBinderTrail
   ```
